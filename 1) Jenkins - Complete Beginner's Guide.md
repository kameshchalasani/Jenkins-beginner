# **📌 Jenkins - Complete Beginner's Guide** 🚀  

Jenkins is one of the most popular tools for **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)** in DevOps. Let’s dive deep into its **importance, architecture, setup, and usage.**  

---

## **🔹 What is Jenkins?**  
Jenkins is an **open-source automation server** that helps developers:  
✅ Automate the **build, test, and deployment** process.  
✅ Implement **CI/CD pipelines** for software development.  
✅ Improve **collaboration** between development & operations teams.  
✅ Run **scheduled & triggered** builds based on code changes.  

🔹 **Jenkins Key Features:**  
✔ **Free & Open-Source**  
✔ **Extensive Plugin Ecosystem**  
✔ **Works with Any Language (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.)**  
✔ **Integrates with GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.**  
✔ **Supports Parallel & Distributed Builds**

## **🔹 Importance of CI/CD in Software Development**
### **1️⃣ Continuous Integration (CI)**
- **Automatically build & test code** every time a developer commits changes.  
- Ensures that **new code does not break the existing system**.  
- Example: When a developer pushes code to GitHub, Jenkins can trigger a build and run unit tests.  

### **2️⃣ Continuous Delivery (CD)**
- After successful testing, the software is **automatically deployed to staging or production**.  
- Reduces the risk of **manual errors** and ensures **fast releases**.  
- Example: Jenkins deploys a **tested build to a staging server** for review.  

### **3️⃣ Continuous Deployment (CD)**
- Fully automates deployment **without manual intervention**.  
- Ideal for **fast-moving DevOps teams**.  
- Example: Every successful build is deployed directly to production servers.  

🚀 **Jenkins makes CI/CD easy by automating these processes!**

## **🔹 Jenkins Architecture & Components**
Jenkins follows a **client-server model** with a **Master-Agent** architecture.  

### **1️⃣ Jenkins Master**
- Controls the **overall Jenkins environment**.  
- Manages **job scheduling, UI, plugin management, logs, and user authentication**.  
- Can run jobs but is usually used for **coordination**.  

### **2️⃣ Jenkins Agent (Slave)**
- Executes the actual **builds, tests, and deployments**.  
- Can run on **different OS (Linux, Windows, macOS, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)**.  
- **Distributed builds:** Jenkins Master assigns jobs to Agents for parallel execution.  

### **3️⃣ Key Components**
✔ **Jobs (Freestyle, Pipelines, Multibranch Pipelines)** – Define what Jenkins should do.  
✔ **Build Triggers** – Start jobs automatically (e.g., Git push, scheduled cron jobs).  
✔ **Plugins** – Extend Jenkins functionality (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub integration).  
✔ **Workspaces & Artifacts** – Store build outputs and logs.

## **🔹 How Jenkins Works (Master-Agent Concept)**
1️⃣ Developer commits code to **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**.  
2️⃣ Jenkins Master **detects the change** and schedules a job.  
3️⃣ Master sends the job to an **available Agent**.  
4️⃣ Agent **executes the build, runs tests, and deploys the application**.  
5️⃣ Jenkins collects logs and notifies **Slack, Email, or JIRA**.  

🔥 **Result:** Fast, automated, and error-free software delivery!

## **🔹 Installing Jenkins (Windows, Linux, Docker)**
You can install Jenkins on **Windows, Linux, or using Docker**.

### **1️⃣ Install Jenkins on Ubuntu/Linux**
```sh
# Install Java (Jenkins requires Java 11 or 17)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

# Add Jenkins repository
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list

# Install Jenkins
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y

# Start & Enable Jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```
👉 **Access Jenkins:** Open `http://localhost:8080`  

---

### **2️⃣ Install Jenkins on Windows**
1️⃣ Download Jenkins **Windows Installer (.msi)** from [Jenkins Official Site](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).  
2️⃣ Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.  
3️⃣ After installation, open a browser and go to **`http://localhost:8080`**.  
4️⃣ Retrieve the **Admin Password** from  
   ```
   C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword
   ```
5️⃣ Complete the setup by installing suggested plugins.  

---

### **3️⃣ Run Jenkins in Docker (Recommended)**
```sh
# Pull the latest Jenkins image
docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts

# Run Jenkins container
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -d jenkins/jenkins:lts
```
👉 **Access Jenkins:** Open `http://localhost:8080`  

---

## **🔹 Jenkins UI Overview & Configuration**
After installation, Jenkins provides a **web-based UI** to manage jobs.  

### **Jenkins Dashboard Overview**
1️⃣ **New Item** → Create Jobs (Freestyle, Pipelines).  
2️⃣ **Manage Jenkins** → System Configuration, Plugins, Credentials.  
3️⃣ **Build History** → View Previous Builds & Logs.  
4️⃣ **Credentials** → Manage Secret Keys & Access Tokens.  
5️⃣ **Plugins Manager** → Install & Update Plugins.
